# TAS Battle
### Tool Assisted Speedrun Battle

TAS Battle is a mod that allows players to connect to a Server where they can play in Slow Motion [Tool Assisted Speedruns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun). For Minecraft you use a mod called Tickrate Changer to slow the game down. The Game runs at 20 ticks per second so 10 will be 50% speed.

## How do I start?

Once you installed the Mod together with FabricAPI for Minecraft 1.16.5 you are automatically being thrown into a gui where you can choose to connect or speed up.
This might look confusing to you, but when you click on connect you can play with other people. when you are recording you can use the speed up button to speed up the video automatically.
